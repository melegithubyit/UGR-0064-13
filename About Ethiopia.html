        <p class="mx-auto" style="width: 85%; text-align: justify;">The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is located in the north-eastern part of Africa commonly known as the
            Horn of
            Africa. It is strategically proximate to the Middle East and Europe, together with its easy access to the major
            ports of
            the region, enhances its international trade. <br><br> It is bordered by the Sudan in the west, Somalia and
            Djibouti in the east,
            Eritrea in the north and Kenya in the south. The country covers 1,112,000 square kilometres (472,000 sq. miles)
            making
            it roughly as large as France and Spain combined and is five times the size of the UK.
    
            From the north and running down the center are the Abyssinian highlands. <br><br> To the west of the chain the
            land drops to the
            grasslands of Sudan, to the east to the deserts of the Afar. South of Addis Ababa, the land is dominated by the
            Rift
            Valley Lakes.
    
            Ethiopia's central plateau varies in height between 2,000 and 3,000 meters. In the north and center of the
            country there
            are some 25 mountains whose peaks rise over 4,000 meters (13,200ft), the highest being Ras Dashen at 4,543
            meters
            (14,538ft).</p>

                        enormous diversity and as a result Ethiopia has more than 80 languages and over 200 dialects.
                        Amharic or Amharigna is the official language of Ethiopia although the government encourages local languages
                        to be
                        taught in schools. The working languages of the national/regional governments may differ according to
                        regions. Other
                        main languages include Oromigna and Tigrigna are also widely spoken. <br> The variety of the language tells us
                        that the country is ethnically diverse nations. more than 80 differnt ethnic groups are present in Ethiopia.
                        The Oromos constitiute the largest population with 34.4% followed by the Amharas with 27%, Somalis with

            <p class="mx-auto" style="width: 85%; text-align: justify;">With a population of about 110.14 million, Ethiopia represents a melting pot of ancient cultures with Middle
                Eastern and
                African cultures evident in the religious, ethnic and language composition of its Semitic, Cushitic, Omotic
                and Nilotic
                peoples. The Ethiopian peoples comprise about eighty nationalities of which the Amhara and the Oromo
                constitute the
                majority, with about 60 percent of the total population. Approximately 85 percent of the population live in
                the rural
                areas. <br><br>
                The annual population growth rate is about 3.09 percent, and the economically active segment, between ages
                14 and
                60, is about 50 percent of the total population. Ethiopia is a Federal Democratic Republic composed of 9
                National
                Regional States (NRS) – Tigray, Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somali, Benishangul-Gumuz, Southern Nations,
                Nationalities and
                Peoples Region (SNNPR), Gambella and Harari – and two administrative councils – Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa.
                The NRS and
                the Administrative councils are further divided into 62 zones and 523 woredas.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center" style="color: #83144c;">Time and Climate</h1>
        <p class="mx-auto" style="width: 85%; text-align: justify;">Ethiopia is in the +3 hrs GMT time zone. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that in addition to this Ethiopia
            also
            has its own time. This is based on the conception that the Ethiopian day is constituted of roughly 12 hours of
            daylight,
            starting at 6.00am and roughly 12 hours of darkness, starting at 6.00pm. So, 7.00am is 1.00am Ethiopian time.
            <br><br>
            Urban Ethiopians often use both systems as appropriate. Nevertheless, in general, when asking about dates and
            times, it
            is always worth checking which system is being used!
            Also about its climate in Ethiopia there are two seasons.
            in most of the country the dry season prevails from October until May with short rains in March; the wet season
            runs
            from June until the end of September. In the Omo and Mago parks however, in Southern Ethiopia, the seasons are
            different
            with the main rains from March to June, and shorter rains in November.
            <br><br>
            Although Ethiopia lies within 15 degrees north of the equator, owing to the moderating influence of high
            altitude, the
            central highlands, where most Ethiopian people live, generally enjoy a temperate and pleasant climate. In the
            highlands
            above 2,000 meters the temperature rarely exceeds 25°C in most of the country. In the lower lying areas (Awash,
            Omo and
            Mago parks), which experience sub-tropical and tropical climates, it can get considerably hotter. The
            temperature
            generally drops quite rapidly towards sunset.

                    latitude 33′ and 48′ longitude bordering Somalia, the Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya and Eritrea with a total border length
                    of 5,311 km. Its proximity to the Middle East and Europe, together with its easy access to the major ports of the
                    region, enhances its international trade.The most famous Ethiopian river is the Blue Nile or Abbay, which flows a
                    distance of 1,450 kilometers from its
                    source to join the White Nile at Khartoum. From the north and running down the centre are the Abyssinian highlands.
                    To the west of the chain the land drops to the grasslands of Sudan, to the east to the deserts of the Afar. South of
