                <h2>Best Time To Visit Ethiopia</h2>
                <div class="last-para">
                    <p>The best time to visit Ethiopia is September to April, but particularly at either end of the rainy season. Travel in
                    April, when the land is dry and barren, or as it flourishes again in September-October. This green season is also best
                    for highland wildlife.
                
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Ethiopia's annual Christian celebration, Timkat, takes place around the middle of January and, although crowded with
                    tourists and known for large gatherings, this is an amazing event to witness firsthand especially with the relatively
                    mild temperatures.</i></li>

                    <li><i>If you're planning on visiting Ethiopia any time over their winter period, which runs until February, you need to be
                    aware that it can get cold in the highlands, especially at night.</i></li>

                    <li><i>The Simien Mountains and northern areas, around towns like Lalibela, start to get a little warmer from March and
                    trekkers will find ideal conditions with the occasional shower never too problematic.</i></li>

                    <li><i>Regions around the Omo Valley in the southwest of Ethiopia are the first to experience the shorter belg rains in April
                    with the wetter weather moving eastwards into Bale Mountains National Park and the Rift Valley Lakes during May and
                    June.</i></li>

                    <li><i>As the heavier and more permanent rains of the kiremt season really start to kick in around Simiens and Bale in July and
                    August it's probably advisable to give them a miss around this time of year and opt for Omo and Mago National Parks
                    instead.</i></li>

                    <li><i>Ethiopia's rainy season can stretch into September although around October you'll find the best time of year to visit
                    the central highlands and northern circuit with lush green landscapes featuring carpets of yellow meskel flowers as well
                    as easier travelling conditions.</i></li>

                    <li><i>One of the best times to visit the South Omo Valley and the Danakil Depression on the Eritrean border are the months of
                    November and December as temperatures are lower with little or no rainfall.</i></li>

                    <li><i>In general, avoid the rainy season from June to August and bear in mind lower temperatures the higher the altitude and
                    hotter conditions the lower you go and the further east you travel.</i></li>
