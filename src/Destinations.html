                <p>The Simien Mountains in northern Ethiopia, north east of Gondar in Amhara region, are part of the Ethiopian Highlands.
                They are a World Heritage Site and include the Simien Mountains National Park. The mountains consist of plateaus
                separated by valleys and rising to pinnacles. The highest Ethiopian mountain is Ras Dejen at 4,550 m with the second
                highest peak of Kidis Yared at 4,453 m; other notable peaks include Mount Biuat at 4,437 m.
                
                The Simien Mountains are remarkable as being one of the few spots in tropical Africa where snow regularly falls.[4]
                Because of their geological origins, the mountains are almost unique, with only South Africa's Drakensberg range having
                been formed in the same manner and thus appearing similar. Notable animals in the mountains include the walia ibex,
                gelada, and caracal. There are a few Ethiopian wolves.</p>

                    <p>Lalibela is a town in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Located in the Lasta district and North Wollo Zone, it is a tourist
                    site for its famous rock-cut monolithic churches. The whole of Lalibela is a large and important site for the antiquity,
                    medieval, and post-medieval civilization of Ethiopia. To Christians, Lalibela is one of Ethiopia's holiest cities, and a
                    center of pilgrimage. Ethiopia was one of the earliest nations to adopt Christianity in the first half of the 4th
                    century, and its historical roots date to the time of the Apostles. 
                    <br><br>
                    The churches themselves date from the 7th to 13th
                    centuries, and are traditionally dated to the reign of the Zagwe (Agaw) king Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (1181–1221). The
                    layout and names of the major buildings in Lalibela are widely accepted, especially by local clergy, to be a symbolic
                    representation of Jerusalem. This has led some experts to date the current church construction to the years following
                    the capture of Jerusalem in 1187 by the Muslim leader Saladin. Lalibela is roughly 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) above sea
                    level. It is the main town in Lasta, which was formerly part of the Bugna district. The rock-hewn churches were declared
                    a World Heritage Site in 1978.

                <h2>Castel Of Fasiledes</h2>
                <h3>The Palaces and Castles of Gondar, Ethiopia.</h3>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>The Castle of Fasil is a fortress located in Gondar, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. It was founded in the 17th
                    century by Emperor Fasilides and was the home of Ethiopian emperors. Its unique architecture shows diverse influences
                    including Nubian, Indian, Arab, and Baroque characteristics. Because of its historical importance and architecture,
                    the fortress was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. Ghebbi is an Amharic word for a compound or
                    enclosure.
                    
                    The complex of buildings includes Fasilides' castle, Iyasu I's palace, Dawit III's Hall, Empress Mentewab's castle, a
                    chancellery and library from Yohannes I, a banqueting hall from the emperor Bakaffa, stables, and three churches:
                    Asasame Qeddus Mikael, Elfign Giyorgis and Gemjabet Mariyam.</p>

                    <p>Formerly the heart of the Axumite empire that spanned for nearly one thousand years, Axum is home to a 24-metre megalith
                    surrounded by a ring of smaller Obelisks. Built in the 4th century by King Ezana, the 160 tonne monument had stood in
                    place for over a thousand years, until the colonial aspirations of a nation far from Ethiopia arrived at her borders.
                    The Italian occupation of Ethiopia is considered by many a period of hardship within the country, with many long hidden
                    artefacts and national treasures being stolen by the occupiers, and despite its mammoth measurements, the Monolith of
                    Axum was taken from Ethiopians in the 1930s. Found, semi-submerged in a pit by a group of Italian soldiers in 1935, the
                    Obelisk was removed from its home, partially dismantled, and after over two years in limbo, was transported to Rome as a
                    spoil of war.

                <h2>Denakil depression</h2>
                <h3>The Lowest Inhabited Area On Earth.</h3>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>The Danakil Depression formed from the continental drift of the African and Asian tectonic plates. As the plates drifted
                    apart at a rate of 1-2 cm per year, they leave behind a geological depression, known as the Danakil Depression (or Afar
                    Depression).
                    
                    The Danakil Depression sits at the triple junction between three tectonic plates.
                    
                    The Afar Depression spans Djibouti, Eritrea, and the Afar region of Ethiopia. 
                    <br><br> The Northern part of this depression is
                    the Danakil Depression, which sits more than 100m below sea level and contains some of the world’s most extraterrestrial
                    landscapes.
                    
                    Beyond its fascinating geology, the Danakil holds the keys to some of biology’s most profound questions. <br><br>
                     In 1974,
                    researchers found the remains of ‘Lucy’ in the Danakil Depression, an early ancestor of modern humans dating back 3.2
                    million years (now on display at the National Museum in Addis Ababa). The acidic springs of the Dallol Crater have
                    attracted scientists in the search for extremophile microbes as they seek to understand the origins of life on Earth, as
                    well as the possibilities for early-stage life on Mars.</p>

                    <p>Who doesn’t love a good cave? Sof Omar Caves is the longest cave in Ethiopia at 15.1 kilometres (9.4 mi) long. When
                    surveyed in 1972, it was the longest cave in Africa. Sof Omar Caves has a total of four entrances and tours are available from one to three hours DIY or two to four hours
                    with a guide. 
                    <br><br> Sof Omar Caves is known for the Sof Omar Cave pool which visitors can swim in, if they choose to do so and
                    it gets its name because of the ‘sof’ (meaning ‘cold’) and ‘omar’ (meaning ‘milk’) that would form on the rocks at
                    certain times of day. Sof Omar is a relatively unspoiled natural phenomenon and it gives visitors an interesting insight
                    into the beautiful African landscape. 
                    <br><br>
                    Sof Omar Caves is located in Sof Omar County within the Bale Mountains National
                    Park, which is also home to famous Echo Valley, known for its wonderful hiking trails through lush forests and home to
                    endemic wildlife such as the Ethiopian wolf and the Menelik’s bushbuck. Sof Omar Caves is definitely a must visit when
                    you’re in Ethiopia, Sof Omar County or Sof Omar County, just to name a few places!
